# Feedback Server

This is the backend server for the feedback application. It's built using Node.js and provides an API for handling feedback submissions.

## Key Technologies

This server-side application utilizes the following important packages:

* **Express (`express`):** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. We use Express to build our API endpoints and handle routing for feedback submissions.

* **Mongoose (`mongoose`):** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js. Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model application data and interact with our MongoDB database.

* **CORS (`cors`):** A Node.js package for providing Connect/Express middleware that can enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This is essential for allowing our frontend application (running on a different origin) to communicate with this server.

* **Dotenv (`dotenv`):** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This is used to manage sensitive information like database connection strings and API keys securely.

* **Morgan (`morgan`):** HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. Morgan helps in logging details of incoming requests to the server, which is useful for debugging and monitoring.

* **Nodemon (`nodemon`):** A development dependency that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. This significantly improves the development workflow by eliminating the need for manual server restarts.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd feedback-server
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your environment-specific variables. For example:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=5000
    # Add other environment variables as needed
    ```
    **Note:** Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running, and replace `mongodb://your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection URI.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command uses `nodemon` to start the server. Any changes you make to the server files will automatically restart the server.

## Available Scripts

* `npm run test`: Currently configured to output an error message as no tests are specified. You would typically replace this with your testing framework's command (e.g., `jest`, `mocha`).
* `npm run dev`: Starts the development server using `nodemon` for automatic restarts on file changes.

## API Endpoints

[Document the API endpoints that your server exposes. For example:]

* `POST /api/feedback`: Accepts feedback data (e.g., fullName, email, feedbackMessage) in the request body and saves it to the database.
